## To run locally

- Clone the repo/download the zip
- `npm install && npm start`
- View app at `localhost:3000`

## TODOs

- TESTS TESTS TESTS
  - I'm most bummed that I ran out of time to implement any testing
  - My preference would be to use `react-testing-library`
- From a design standpoint I think it'd be nice to add a tooltip on focus to display class, row and seat
